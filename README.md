# Sonisight

In Sonisight, vision has betrayed you and sound is your only ally. You will need to use the sound waves you can see to navigate the level and hunt down your enemies, while being careful of the sounds you make. Each footstep or gunshot must be chosen carefully, as every sound you make will lead your enemies closer and closer to hunting you down. Survive, track, and kill your opponents to win. Do you have what it takes?

## What is This Game?

The basic, barebones prototype for Sonisight was created for a game jam in 36 hours by two extremely sleep-deprived university students on the basis of an offhand idea one of them had happened to have two months before while in the shower. Extremely junior developers [HalfPastEight](https://github.com/mineus64) and [Spaceguy](https://github.com/Spaceguy5234) came together to make an amateur project, and decided thereafter to flesh it out and finish it up. What you see before you is the result of their, and others', efforts.
